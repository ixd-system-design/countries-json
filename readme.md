# Countries 
This demo is similar to [Variety Shoe](https://bender.sheridanc.on.ca/system-design/variety-shoe). It uses a [dataset of countries via @mledoze](https://github.com/mledoze/countries/).

# Sorting
A key feature in this demo is the sorting of data. In particular it's possible to sort an array of objects based on some common property that all those objects have. The [array sort function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) is quite useful here. In this demo, Countries are sorted by area.

# Learning Prompts
- Fork this code
- Modify the template to show additional properties for each country.
- Challenge: For each country, include a bullet list of all languages.
- Use CSS to create a grid layout
